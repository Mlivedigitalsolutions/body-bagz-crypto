What you’ll do in Replit (high level steps your automation should follow)
• Parse /brand/spec/manifest.yaml.
• Render vectors for each logos[] item from the descriptions (your script or model can procedurally draw or call your image gen). Keep geometry crisp; no raster text baked into SVGs.
• Export every logo in all export_profiles. Respect safe_margins.outer_padding_percent and keep transparent backgrounds where specified.
• Assemble docs 
• Generate brand_sheet.pdf with color chips, clearspace diagram, and key lockups.
• Write the README from docs.readme.
• Organize into the output_tree folders and zip per packaging.
• Commit & push the /brand/output directory to: 
• mlivedigitalsolutions/body-bagz-crypto → /brand/output on main.
• Echo final paths + a small HTML index for quick preview.
Notes to keep the renders consistent
• Eyes always neon_green glow with soft outer bloom; no red eyes on official primary.
• Visor uses visor_teal frame with thin neon_green HUD lines; avoid chrome or heavy reflections.
• Circuit halo around skull is circuit_purple, radial but not symmetrical copy-paste—vary node spacing to feel organic.
• Wordmark: toxic_green solid fill, no gradient, no outline. Always all caps “BODY BAGZ”.
• Provide transparent and black-bg variants for the cinematic look.
• For embroidery/patch use, rely on one-color and monochrome assets only.
