Change VISUALS ONLY. Keep existing structure, but restyle everything to feel rare, modern, and intimidating—sleek cyberpunk streetwear, not cartoony.

PALETTE (use these hexes exactly):
- Jet Black: #0A0A0B (base), Onyx: #111214 (panels)
- Blood Red (primary glow): #E7352C
- Toxic Neon Green (accent): #39FF14
- Glitch Purple (secondary accent): #7A3BFF
- Ash White (text): #EDEEF0
- Dim Gray (muted text/borders): #2A2B31
All accents should glow softly against black (outer/inner shadow + blur). Maintain AA contrast.

TYPOGRAPHY:
- H1/H2 (brand headers): heavy, condensed, sharp-edged sans (graffiti-tech vibe). Examples: “Anton”/“Oswald”/“Bebas Neue”-style. Track slightly tight. Add subtle glitch/scanline layer.
- H3/H4 (section labels): narrow all-caps geometric sans (e.g., “Orbitron”/“Exo 2” vibe).
- Body: clean geometric sans (e.g., “Inter”/“Montserrat”), 16–18px on mobile, 18–20px desktop, 1.6–1.75 line-height.
- Numerals/metrics: tabular figures. Avoid rounded/cute fonts.

LAYOUT & FEEL:
- Grid: 12-col desktop, 4-col mobile. Generous negative space. Section max-width ~1200px; gutters 24–32px.
- Panels/Cards: #111214 with 1px inner border (#2A2B31) and outer neon glow (primary red). Hover: pulse glow + faint green rim.
- Dividers: custom SVG “glitch lines” or zipper motifs, not plain HRs. Use subtle parallax.

HERO (above the fold):
- Full-bleed dark scene with *very subtle* animated fog/smoke (low opacity), faint red grid in background.
- CENTERPIECE: vector grim reaper silhouette SVG (matte black) with minimal neon edges; no cartoon faces. Keep it iconic and simple.
- Title “BODY BAGZ” in blood red with micro-glitch (offset duplicate + mask jitter); subline:
  “ZIP IT. STACK IT. OWN IT.” with alternating green/purple flicker.
- CTA buttons: black pill with red outer glow; hover adds green flicker and slight scale (1.02).

ICONOGRAPHY (SVG only, no emojis):
- Skull, zipper, body bag tag, barcode, gas mask, chain links. Style: thin-to-medium strokes, angular corners, neon rim-light.
- Use monotone fills with neon strokes; avoid gradients except subtle edge glow.

ANIMATIONS (subtle, never noisy):
- Glitch: brief 150–250ms text displacement on hover/scroll reveal.
- Fog: slow, <10% opacity.
- Button hover: red→green rim transition, 120–180ms ease.
- Card reveal: upward 8–12px with fade, slight red glow bloom.

BUTTONS/CHIPS:
- Primary: #0A0A0B bg, #E7352C outer glow, Ash White text.
- Secondary: outline neon green with transparent black fill.
- Small pill chips for tags (“CHAOS”, “CULTURE”, “PEOPLE”) with thin neon borders.

FORMS (tweet/meme/pfp generators):
- Black inputs with inner glow, square corners, thin neon caret.
- Placeholder text in Dim Gray; focus ring neon green.

MERCH PREVIEW (coming soon):
- Black hoodie SVG mock on #0A0A0B with red under-lighting; graffiti “BODY BAGZ” in red with subtle green overspray. Overlay “COMING SOON” as white/green scanline text.

CHART/REAL-TIME DATA:
- Embed chart within a dark card; legend and ticks in Ash White; accent lines use green/purple; highlight candles with red glow.

ACCESSIBILITY & POLISH:
- Maintain high contrast for all text (#EDEEF0 on #0A0A0B).
- Reduce saturation of greens/purples by ~10% on mobile to avoid eye strain.
- Motion-safe: disable nonessential animations if prefers-reduced-motion.

FINAL FEEL:
- Sleek, intimidating, and premium. Black canvas, controlled neon glow, glitch micro-effects, crisp typography, generous spacing. No cute/rounded visuals. Everything should look like a high-end underground brand hub.
