Mobile-optimize the “Rug Hunter” mini-game for Body Bagz. Keep existing site features untouched (SEO/routes). Prioritize buttery mobile play, one-thumb control, and low input latency.

CORE: GAME & CONTROLS
- Default control scheme = GESTURES (one-hand):
  • Swipe LEFT/RIGHT: dash horizontally (lane change or short strafe).
  • Swipe UP: jump (clear hazards).
  • Swipe DOWN: slide/dodge (pass under hazards).
  • TAP anywhere: TAG/attack nearest “rugger” in front (auto-aim within small cone).
- Accessibility: toggle to BUTTONS mode in the HUD:
  • Bottom-left: ⬅️ ⮕ (move left/right)
  • Bottom-right: large “TAG” button; above it a small “JUMP”; swipe-down still triggers SLIDE.
  • Buttons should be 56–64px with 8–12px spacing (thumb-friendly), placed in “thumb zones”.
- Input polish:
  • Input buffering 120ms (queue one action).
  • Gesture dead-zone & min distance to avoid accidental triggers.
  • Attack assist: expand hurtbox by 8–12px toward facing direction.
  • Cooldowns: TAG 250ms, JUMP 500ms, SLIDE 500ms (cancel windows feel responsive).
  • Haptics (Vibration API): 15ms on tag hit, 35ms on damage, 60ms on game-over (fallback safe).
  • Sound: unlock WebAudio on first touch; single master limiter to prevent clipping.

PERFORMANCE ON MOBILE
- Phaser 3 in a <GameCanvas/> component; lock target 60 FPS with dynamic resolution scaling (0.75 on low-end via RAF delta).
- Use requestAnimationFrame visibility pause; reduce particle count & shadow effects on “Performance Mode.”
- Sprite atlas & compressed textures (webp/avif) under /public/game/rughunter/.
- Sprite sizes targeting 720p logical canvas (scale up to device DPR).
- Avoid layout thrash: canvas as fixed-layer element; translate3d for HUD animations.
- Lazy-load game chunk with React.lazy/Suspense.

UI/UX & BRAND
- Cyberpunk/villain theme (jet black bg, neon #39FF14 + glitch purple accent).
- HUD top: SCORE (large), TIME, COMBO “Villain Streak xN”.
- Pause button (top-right) → Resume / Controls / Performance Mode / Exit.
- Game-over panel (full-screen modal):
  • Final Score, Best Score (local), Combo Peak, Time Survived.
  • CTAs: “Post a Chaos Tweet” (deep-link to Tweet Generator), “Climb Leaderboard”, “Play Again”.
- Safe areas: respect device notches; maintain 12–16px edge insets; minimum tap targets 44px.

GAME LOOP
- 60–120s session target with difficulty ramp every 20s (spawn rate & speed).
- Tagging “ruggers” = +10; coins = +1; streak multiplier when tagging without being hit.
- 3 hits = game-over; brief invuln on hit (500ms).
- Camera subtle screen-shake on hits & drops (mobile-friendly amplitude).

BACKEND INTEGRATION (unchanged endpoints)
- On game-over:
  POST /api/actions/track { userId, actionType: "arcade_score", points }
  • points = floor(score/10), max 50 per session.
  POST /api/users/:userId/content
  { contentType:"game_score", title:"Rug Hunter", content:"{score:N}", metadata:{mode:"mobile"} }
- Add “Arcade” tab to /leaderboard view filtering arcade_score actions.

ANALYTICS
- POST /api/analytics events: game_start, game_end {score,duration,controls:"gestures|buttons"}, tag_hit, coin_pickup, damage_taken, settings_changed.

ROUTING & NAV
- New route: /game/rughunter; Nav: “Games ▸ Rug Hunter”.
- Add home hero chip “Mobile Ready • One-Thumb Controls”.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Reduce-motion toggle (disables shakes/ambient effects).
- All buttons have aria-labels; color-contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for HUD text.
- Provide text “How to Play” with animated GIF demo (under the game, collapsible).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Gestures work smoothly on iOS/Android (Safari/Chrome), with <100ms perceived latency.
- Optional Buttons mode, persistent via localStorage.
- 60 FPS on modern phones; auto-scales on low-end.
- Score posts to backend; Arcade tab shows monthly points.
- No regressions to homepage, Tweet Generator, Meme Factory, or PFP pages.

FILE LAYOUT
- /src/game/rughunter/
  • GameCanvas.tsx (React host)
  • scenes/MainScene.ts, ui/Hud.ts, input/GestureInput.ts, input/ButtonsInput.ts
  • assets in /public/game/rughunter/ (placeholders ok)
