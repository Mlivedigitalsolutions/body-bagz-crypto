Update the Body Bagz site with three new top-level pages and safe backend support. DO NOT refactor unrelated code or break existing routes/SEO.

GOALS (open in new page/tab from the homepage cards)
1) /mission  → “Why We Exist” long-form page
2) /meetups  → Community Meetups hub (registered users can post; images allowed)
3) /market   → Peer-to-Peer Marketplace hub (registered users can post; images allowed)

NAV & HOMEPAGE
- Keep the three neon cards on the homepage but turn each into a link that opens in a NEW TAB (target="_blank", rel="noopener").
  • FOR THE CULTURE → /mission
  • FOR THE CHAOS → /meetups
  • FOR THE PEOPLE → /market
- Add a “Movement” menu with Mission, Meetups, Marketplace.

PAGE CONTENT & UX
A) /mission (document page)
- Headline: “Why We Exist — The Villain Era Manifesto”
- Sections:
  • Mission: “Give Gen Z tools, culture, and power to fight rigged systems while building real value together.”
  • Dual Token Thesis: Moonshot = Villain Era (stability, staking base). Pump.fun = Chaos Energy (volatility, meme force).
  • Call to Action: Join TG, use Tweet Generator, climb Leaderboard, show up at meetups.
- Include a CTA row: “Join Telegram”, “Use Tweet Generator”, “View Leaderboard”.

B) /meetups (Community Meetups)
- Visible to all for browsing; posting requires login (use existing auth pattern).
- Features:
  • Feed of meetup posts (card list): title, city, date/time, description, tags, images (max 4), creator handle, RSVP count.
  • Filters: by city, date range, tags (“shill-raid”, “IRL-sticker-run”, “launch-party”, etc.)
  • Post composer (logged-in only): title (max 80), description (max 1,000), location (city/country), date/time (ISO), tags (multi-select), image upload (1–4).
  • RSVPs: logged-in users can RSVP/Un-RSVP; show count + avatars.
  • Comments (optional v2 toggle; stub UI okay with disabled backend).
- Mobile-first layout; large tap targets; safe-area padding for notches.
- Add a sidebar panel: “Community Rules” (no doxxing, no hate, legal only; mods may remove).

C) /market (P2P Marketplace)
- Visible to all; posting requires login.
- Features:
  • Listings feed (card list): title, category (art/music/merch/services/events/other), price (text input, optional), description, images (up to 6), seller handle, contact method (X handle, TG @user; no emails required).
  • Filters: category, “has images”, sort by newest.
  • Post composer (logged-in only), same validations as meetups but allow up to 6 images.
  • Button “Pay with $BAGZ (Coming Soon)” placeholder; later we can wire token checkout.
  • Report Listing button → POST a report entry for mods.
- Warning banner: “Peer-to-peer at your own risk. No escrow. Verify before meeting or trading.”

BACKEND (Express) — add minimal, safe endpoints; reuse existing middleware
- Use existing security middleware, generalLimiter/strictLimiter, validateActionTracking where relevant, and error handling.
- Add upload support using multer with disk storage to /public/uploads, OR base64 accept in JSON. Cap file size (e.g., 2 MB per image), restrict types (png,jpg,jpeg,webp). Create /public/uploads/{meetups|market}/yyyy/mm/ filenames with UUID.
- New tables/collections via storage (extend existing storage layer):
  • meetups: id, userId, title, description, city, country, eventAt (datetime), tags (string[]), images (string[] urls), createdAt, updatedAt
  • meetup_rsvps: id, meetupId, userId, createdAt (unique userId+meetupId)
  • listings: id, userId, title, category, description, priceText, images (string[] urls), contact (xUsername|telegramUsername pulled from user profile if missing), createdAt, updatedAt
  • reports: id, type (“listing”|“meetup”), refId, userId, reason, createdAt
- Endpoints (JSON):
  • POST /api/meetups            {title, description, city, country, eventAt, tags[], images[]?} (auth required)
  • GET  /api/meetups            ?q=&city=&from=&to=&tags=&page=&limit=
  • POST /api/meetups/:id/rsvp   { userId } (auth)
  • DELETE /api/meetups/:id/rsvp (auth)
  • POST /api/meetups/upload     multipart/form-data (images[]) → returns array of urls
  • POST /api/market/listings    {title, category, description, priceText?, images[], contact?} (auth)
  • GET  /api/market/listings    ?q=&category=&page=&limit=&hasImages=
  • POST /api/market/upload      multipart/form-data (images[]) → returns array of urls
  • POST /api/report             { type, refId, reason } (auth)
- Sanitize & validate all inputs (lengths, allowed categories/tags). Strip HTML; allow basic markdown in descriptions (render safe).
- Rate limits: strictLimiter on POST routes; generalLimiter on GET routes.
- On successful post creation, also record an action for leaderboard:
  • actionType: "meetup_post" (points 6), "market_post" (points 6), "meetup_rsvp" (points 2)

FRONTEND (React + TS)
- Create pages/components under /src/pages:
  • Mission.tsx
  • Meetups.tsx (Feed, Filters, Composer, RSVP)
  • Marketplace.tsx (Feed, Filters, Composer)
- Shared components: ImageUploader (drag/drop + mobile tap), TagPicker, Pagination, EmptyState.
- Use TanStack Query for data; optimistic updates; skeleton loaders.
- ImageUploader: compress to webp client-side if large; show progress; limit 4 (meetups) / 6 (listings).
- Use existing toasts and neon styling; icons: calendar, map-pin, tag, camera, shield-alert.

SECURITY & MODERATION
- All images scanned by mime-type; reject executable content. Filename randomization.
- Provide simple moderation toggles (v1 stub):
  • Hidden flag on meetups/listings; add GET admin query ?hidden=true for mods.
- Content rules banner on both pages; checkbox “I agree” before posting.

LINKS & INTEGRATION
- From homepage cards:
  • “FOR THE CULTURE” → /mission (new tab)
  • “FOR THE CHAOS” → /meetups (new tab)
  • “FOR THE PEOPLE” → /market (new tab)
- Add “Games ▸ Rug Hunter” link unchanged.
- In post composers, if user profile lacks xUsername/telegramUsername, show tip to update profile at /profile for better contact.

ROADMAP NOTE (to show on /mission and footer)
- Add a “Roadmap 2026” block:
  • Q1 2026: Staking pool for Moonshot; rewards paid in Pump.fun token.
  • Q2 2026: Merch checkout accepts both tokens.
  • Q3 2026: PFP generator random NFT drops with utility.
  • Q4 2026: Rug Hunter P2E economy preview.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Three new routes load in new tabs from homepage cards.
- Logged-in users can create meetups/listings with images; guests can browse.
- Uploads are size/type validated; thumbnails render fast on mobile.
- RSVPs increment and persist; actions tracked to leaderboard.
- No regressions to existing pages (home, tweet generator, meme factory, PFP, leaderboard).
- Lighthouse mobile performance ≥ 85 on new pages.

Do not alter existing SEO meta. Keep styles consistent with the current neon cyberpunk theme.
