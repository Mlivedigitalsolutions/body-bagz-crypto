# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for Body Bagz

## Overview

Your Body Bagz website is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment. The GitHub Pages version will be a **static frontend-only** version of your site - it won't have backend features like database storage or API endpoints, but all the visual content and client-side functionality will work.

## What Will Work on GitHub Pages

✅ **Frontend Features:**
- Complete visual design with cyberpunk styling  
- All static pages (Home, Gaming, Community, etc.)
- Client-side routing between pages
- Responsive design across devices
- CSS animations and effects
- Static content display

❌ **What Won't Work (Backend Required):**
- User authentication/login
- AI tools (Tweet Generator, PFP Creator, Meme Generator)  
- Database storage
- Real-time trading data
- User accounts and leaderboards
- Any API endpoints

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `body-bagz`
2. Push your code to the repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/body-bagz.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. The deployment will start automatically when you push to `main` branch

### 3. Repository Name Configuration

The current configuration assumes your repository is named `body-bagz`. If you use a different name:

1. Update line 40 in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Change `base: '/body-bagz/',` to `base: '/your-repo-name/',`

### 4. Access Your Site

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/body-bagz/
```

## File Changes Made

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Creates optimized build configuration for GitHub Pages
- Handles base path configuration
- Creates 404.html for client-side routing support

### Build Process
- Uses Vite to build static assets
- Configures base path for GitHub Pages subdirectory
- Optimizes for production deployment
- Copies index.html to 404.html for SPA routing

## Troubleshooting

**Blank Page Issues:**
- Verify your repository name matches the base path in the workflow
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Ensure the deployment action completed successfully

**Routing Issues:**
- The 404.html file ensures client-side routing works
- All routes will redirect to the main app for handling

**Asset Loading:**
- Images and assets are configured with the proper base path
- CSS and JS files will load from the correct GitHub Pages URL

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If you prefer manual deployment, you can also use the `gh-pages` package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

Then add to package.json scripts:
```json
{
  "deploy": "vite build --base=/body-bagz/ && gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings  
3. Wait for the deployment to complete
4. Visit your live site!

Your GitHub Pages site will automatically update whenever you push changes to the main branch.
